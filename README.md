## Building the site

The site is built using the [Zola static site generator](https://www.getzola.org/).
The content is held on the `main` branch of this repository.

In general you can work on the `main` branch and use the `zola serve` 
command to view what the site will look like locally. Once you are done 
with any changes, commit your changes to the `main` branch, and github actions
will deploy the site.
